### Description

[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) part for a WS2812B LED strip 12V created for this [project](https://github.com/Kuhno92/zero-g-fountain).

Project adapted from https://github.com/zebradog/fritzing-pololu-led-60

Basically I just changed labels from 5V to 12V and edited some properties.
